# Counter-Strike 2 Clutch Predictor

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the outcome of clutch situations in **Counter-Strike 2** based on round, player, and game state features extracted from demo (.dem) files.  

It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on clutch scenarios to predict whether a player will successfully win the clutch.

## Features
- Predicts **clutch success probability** given a game state.  
- Includes an **interactive simulator** to test custom scenarios.  
- Shows **feature importance** (which factors matter most in clutch success).
